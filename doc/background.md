rkyv is the best serialaization-deserialization library for Rust. It provides for unparalleled performance gains with it's use of zero-copy-deserialization (aka ZCD) to enable different use cases. The motivation and the inner working of the rkyv are beautifully described in the "rkvy book" here (https://rkyv.org/). 

This book provides a practical approach to using rkyv in different settings; taking the user from basic to the advanced use cases. Obviously not all uses are covered; but enough to enable the committed user for common use cases. 

Also effort is made to enable the user to extend the base rkyv framework.
